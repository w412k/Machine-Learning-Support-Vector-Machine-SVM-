## Support Vector Machine Exercise Tutorial
This repository contains a practice exercise for implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using the Digit dataset from the scikit-learn library. The goal of this exercise is to predict the names of the digits based on the input features.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this exercise is the Iris dataset, which is available in the scikit-learn library. The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, with each sample having four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the class of the iris plant, which can take one of three possible values: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

#Installation
To run this exercise, you will need to have Python and the scikit-learn library installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install scikit-learn
